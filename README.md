# Air Conditioning Unit Module (Shared Memory)
 
This module should simulate the functionality of an air conditioner, using Shared memory.
We have the server class, which basically represents the air conditioning unit with all the functions it performs (eg: Heats, cools), making it capable of taking on several clients simultaneously.
On the other hand, we have the client class, in which we will enter the desired temperature and the outside temperature, and these will be transmitted to the AC unit using shared memory.
